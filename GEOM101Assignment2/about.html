<h1>About this project</h1>
<p class="abouttext">This page was designed for Fleming College GEOM 101 and I'll take this chance to showcase some of my favourite 
    pictures I've taken while living in Ottawa. Photography is something I've been trying to get into as a hobby!</p>
<p class="abouttext">A large portion of these photos featured here were shot on a Nikon D3500 but a few were taken with an iPhone.</p>

<h2>A little bit about Ottawa</h2>
<p>It is located at INSERT COORDINATES HERE</p>
<p>Insert Google Maps API here</p>
